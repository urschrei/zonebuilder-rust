The crate template was made with the following command:

```bash
cargo new --lib zonebuilder
```

```bash
mv -v zonebuilder/* .               
# renamed 'zonebuilder/Cargo.toml' -> './Cargo.toml'
# renamed 'zonebuilder/src' -> './src'
```

Edit the .rs files in src folder.

Then run:

```bash
cargo test
```
