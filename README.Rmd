# zonebuilder

A rust crate for building zones.

Run the CLI:

```{r, engine='bash'}
cargo run > circle.geojson
```

Then read in the GeoJSON file with another tool, e.g.:

```{r}
circle = sf::read_sf("circle.geojson")
plot(circle)
file.remove("circle.geojson")
```



<!--
The crate template was made with the following command:

```bash
cargo new --lib zonebuilder
```

```bash
mv -v zonebuilder/* .               
# renamed 'zonebuilder/Cargo.toml' -> './Cargo.toml'
# renamed 'zonebuilder/src' -> './src'
```

Edit the .rs files in src folder.

Then run:

```bash
cargo test
```
